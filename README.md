# BOOKS-FE-4

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## BookWorm App
Bookworm is a user-friendly web application designed to act as a central hub for students to access free E-books, organize their study materials, and leverage AI functionalities for summarizing, querying, and quiz creation. 

## What you can do with the app:
- Search by title for any book available on the API
- Do an advanced search by different parameters (title, author, category)
- On the results you can check the book  main category, its saleability (for sale,  not for sale, free), if it's an ebook, and if it has a partial or full preview available
- When checking each book details you'll see the full release date, all categories, authors, description and, depending on the features available for each book, you'll see buttons to buy it, read a sample, read the full book, or add it to your bookshelf.
